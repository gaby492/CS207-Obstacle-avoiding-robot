# CS207-Obstacle-avoiding-robot
CS207 Final Project

The aim of this project is to build the obstacle avoiding robot following the instructions and ideas
provided on the tutorial https://youtu.be/tXsP9STxdBc. The addition to the original idea will be a “notification”
feature. The main idea behind it is allowing the owner to control the robot, so he can decide where the
robot should go, but if there is an obstacle the robot will no longer move forward, instead, he owner will
be notified by an Android application via Bluetooth in the form of vibrations. Then the car will move
backward and change its path. And the owner will be able to control it again.
