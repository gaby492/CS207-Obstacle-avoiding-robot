# CS207-Obstacle-avoiding-robot
CS207 Final Project


The aim of this project is to build the obstacle avoiding robot using the ELEGOO's "Smart Robot Car V3.0" . The main idea behind it is allowing the owner to control the robot, so he can decide where the
robot should go, but if there is an obstacle the robot will no longer move forward, instead, the car will move
backward and change its path. And the owner will be able to control it again.



"Black Line" avoiding code coming soon....
